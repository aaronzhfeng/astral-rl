    \caption{Mean gating weights per mode for a trained \method{} model. Each bar group shows the average weight assigned to each slot when operating in a specific mode. Ideally, different modes would preferentially use different slots, creating a diagonal pattern. The observed pattern shows partial differentiation but significant overlap.}

    \caption{Distribution of gating weights across environment modes for a trained \method{} model. Each subplot shows the histogram of weights for one slot across all timesteps within each mode. In collapsed models (left), one slot dominates regardless of mode. In diverse models (right), weight distributions vary by mode, though clear mode-slot correspondence remains weak.}

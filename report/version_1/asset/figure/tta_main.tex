    \caption{Test-time adaptation results on a trained \method{} model. \textbf{Left}: Comparison of mean return before and after 30 episodes of gating-only adaptation for each mode. \textbf{Middle}: Return during adaptation episodes, showing learning dynamics. \textbf{Right}: Net improvement (after $-$ before) per mode. Results show TTA maintains but does not significantly improve already-high performance.}

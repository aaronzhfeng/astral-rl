% Figure: Training comparison - ASTRAL vs Baseline

    \caption{Training performance comparison between \method{} and the GRU-only baseline. \textbf{Left}: Learning curves over 100k training steps (3 seeds each, smoothed). \method{} successfully learns to solve the task while the baseline fails entirely. \textbf{Right}: Final performance (mean of last 50 episodes). The abstraction bank architecture enables learning even when slot collapse occurs, suggesting the FiLM modulation provides representational benefits independent of slot specialization.}
